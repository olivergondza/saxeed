# Sufficiently Advanced XML Eventing Editor

Your user-friendly SAX wrapper to transform XML files easily, with memory consumption in mind.

## Spirit

Saxeed, a SAX wrapper, stream process XML input performing modifications to its outputs based on predefined transformation(s).

It accepts the constraints of "streaming" (or "eventing") approach â€” elements are visited one-by-one with no option to look ahead in the stream.
This is a tradeoff we accept in return for predictable memory footprint.
